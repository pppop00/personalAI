# 📚 Knowledge Base

This is where you put all your documents!

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a different type of document:

- **Linkedin/** - Your LinkedIn profile, connections, posts
- **ResumeLetter/** - Resumes, cover letters, CVs
- **Git/** - GitHub projects, code descriptions
- **Paper/** - Research papers, articles you've written
- **Company/** - Company information, work documents

You can create more folders as needed!

## 📝 File Format

- All files should be `.md` (Markdown) format
